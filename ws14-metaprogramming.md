# Metaprogramming Seminar

Metaprograms process and produce source code. A metaprogram treats a regular program as data and thus enables abstractions and reflections outside the scope of regular programming languages. Metaprogramming is widely applied in programming languages. From C++ templates and syntactic macros, to model-driven development, domain-specific languages and aspect-oriented programming: Metaprogramming plays a significant role in many modern programming systems. In this seminar, we study the foundations of metaprogramming and its applications in modern software development by reading research papers on the topic.

More details will be announced through this page.

### Kick-off meeting

21.10.2014 17:15-19:00, [Room A302](http://campus.verwaltung.uni-tuebingen.de/lsfpublic/rds?state=verpublish&status=init&vmfile=no&moduleCall=webInfo&publishConfFile=webInfoRaum&publishSubDir=raum&keep=y&raum.rgid=2786).\\

### Expected workload

I miscomputed the seminar workload in the kick-off meeting. After a question, I updated the slides above, *reducing* the expected workload.

### Course structure

During the semester, we will discuss together a paper each week in a meeting. Everybody should read the paper in advance, prepare and submit a short summary and questions (150-300 words). A discussion leader should dig deeper on the topic, also based on the questions by other students, and prepare to moderate the discussion. The role of discussion leader rotates among students.

At the end of the semester, each participant should submit a short term paper, surveying one of the discussed topics.

The seminar is graded, and the final grade depends on both the summaries, the participation to the discussion, and the final term paper.

### Tips on reading papers

There are different approaches to reading a research paper, some more productive than others. While there are no strict rules, you might want to take a look at the following:

* Philip W. L. Fong, 2004. [How to Read a CS Research Paper?](http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/chikh/Documents/reading-paper.pdf) (4 pages).
* S. Keshav, 2007. [How to Read a Paper](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/wordpress/wp-content/themes/netmit/papers/HowtoRead.pdf) (2 pages).


### Absence policy

This seminar is a discussion seminar, so it is necessary that you actually attend meetings in order to benefit from the seminar and pass the exam.

You are allowed to miss at most two of the meetings and still pass the seminar. Should this become a problem and should the absences be due to justifiable reasons, we *might* be able to agree on alternative loads to compensate for the absences.

### Registering: Doodle poll for timeslot

If you are interested to participate, please send me an email with name, student number, course and a short summary of favored languages or relevant experience.

We picked the timeslot with a [Doodle poll](http://doodle.com/bnx7773c7msnq29i), now closed. I might reopen this poll, should the necessity arise.
