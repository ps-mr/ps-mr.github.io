# Metaprogramming Seminar

Metaprograms process and produce source code. A metaprogram treats a regular program as data and thus enables abstractions and reflections outside the scope of regular programming languages. Metaprogramming is widely applied in programming languages. From C++ templates and syntactic macros, to model-driven development, domain-specific languages and aspect-oriented programming: Metaprogramming plays a significant role in many modern programming systems. In this seminar, we study the foundations of metaprogramming and its applications in modern software development by reading research papers on the topic.

More details will be announced through this page.

### Kick-off meeting

21.10.2014 17:15-19:00, [Room A302](http://campus.verwaltung.uni-tuebingen.de/lsfpublic/rds?state=verpublish&status=init&vmfile=no&moduleCall=webInfo&publishConfFile=webInfoRaum&publishSubDir=raum&keep=y&raum.rgid=2786).

### Course structure

During the semester, we will discuss together a paper each week in a meeting. Everybody should read the paper in advance, prepare and submit a short summary and questions. A discussion leader (a different student each week) should dig deeper on the topic, also based on the questions by other students, and prepare to moderate the discussion.

At the end of the semester, each participant should submit a short term paper, surveying one of the discussed topics.

The seminar is graded, and the note depends on both the summaries, the participation to the discussion, and the final term papers.
