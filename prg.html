<h1>Paper Reading Group</h2>

<p>
Welcome to the web page of the Paper Reading Group organized by the Ostermann group.
The organization is done by <a href="mailto:giarrusso@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de">Paolo Giarrusso</a>.
</p>

<!--
<p><strong>Place:</strong> 05D15</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> every Thursday at 16:00, unless announced otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Organizer:</strong> Paolo Giarrusso (giarrusso@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de)</p>
-->

<h2>How does our PRG work?</h2>

<p>We read and discuss one paper per meeting. One participant (the
<strong>discussion leader</strong>) will give a short summary and raise
a few points for discussion, but every participant is expected to read
the paper beforehand.</p>
<p>Guests are always welcome!</p>

<p>Please subscribe to our mailing list to be notified about upcoming meetings by mailing the organizer.</p>

<p>The schedule below for discussion leaders is tentative, beyond the next week.</p>

<p>For topics of high significance and technical depth, we might devote two meetings. </p>

<p>The role of discussion leader rotates among participants.</p>

<p>Feel free to propose candidates for future meetings by contacting <a href="mailto:giarrusso@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de">Paolo</a>. Modifying this webpage directly will not work reliably, as its content is auto-generated. </p>
